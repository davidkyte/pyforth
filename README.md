**PyForth Overview**

This is a Forth interpreter written in Python with a modular extension system for small microcontrollers like m5stack atom, core 3, rp2040, etc. \
The project consists of several key components:



**Core Architecture**
~~~
  forth_vm.py - The main virtual machine implementation (26KB)
  Heap-based Forth VM without using Python dictionaries for words
  Implements data stack (S) and return stack (R)
  64KB heap for dictionary storage
  Full Forth language features including:
  Control structures (IF/ELSE/THEN, BEGIN/AGAIN/UNTIL, DO/LOOP)
  Word definition and compilation
  Variables, constants, and CREATE/DOES> constructs
  Number base conversion (HEX/DECIMAL)
  Stack manipulation words
  pf.py - Main entry point
  Initializes the VM
  Loads extensions
  Auto-loads 0.txt if present (for startup scripts)
  Starts the REPL
  Extension System
  The project uses a clean extension mechanism:
~~~
**Extn.py - Core extensions module**

  Bitwise operations (LSHIFT, RSHIFT, AND, OR, XOR, INVERT)
  Python integration (PYTHON word to load/execute Python files)
  File I/O and system integration
'''
**Times3.py - Simple example extension**

  Demonstrates how to add custom words
  Adds a 3* word that multiplies top of stack by 3

**geek-pin.py - Hardware interface for Geek RP2040 board**

  GPIO pin manipulation for embedded applications
  Uses CircuitPython's board and digitalio libraries
  Pin mapping for RP2040 GPIO pins
  Forth words for pin control
  Key Features

**Extension Protocol:** 

  Extensions must have an install(vm) function that adds words using vm.add_fn(name, function)

**Auto-loading:** 

  Looks for 0.txt on startup for initialization scripts

**Hardware Integration:** 

  Designed to work with microcontrollers (RP2040, m5stack atom, core 3, geek-rp2040 )

**Clean Architecture:** 

  Separates core VM from extensions for modularity

**Usage Instructions**

  Don't modify forth_vm.py directly
  Add new functionality to Extn.py or create new extension files
  Extensions are loaded using the PYTHON word in Forth
  The VM automatically calls the install() function when loading the Python modules

Claude overview ...

  This is a well-structured educational/experimental Forth implementation that bridges Python and Forth programming, 
  with particular focus on embedded/hardware applications.
